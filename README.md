# Solve-linear-equations
C++ program to solve linear equations
The program reads first an integer n which is the number of equations.
Then the program reads n lines containing the equations.
For example the input to the program is like:

3
2x1+3x2+4x3=16
1x1+2x2+1x3=8
3x1+1x2+2x3=13

Equation proper form :
1. variables are ordered alphabetically from left to right
2. Any variable should appears only one time
3. Only one constant term should appear in the equation and it should be on the right hand side
4. Coefficient when equals to one or -1 the digit 1 is optional
